# advent_of_code_2023

These are my solutions to the Advent of Code Challenge for 2023. 
If time allows, I'll try to keep the code readable for troubleshooting and as guidance for
any aspiring developers. My comments and style might change over time, as I adapt to each problem
or I find a particular style conducive to these problems.

Right now, I prefer to have each solution self-contained, so I'm leaning away from
any kind of utility functions universal to every problem (ie. like reading in a file, string parsing, etc.).
